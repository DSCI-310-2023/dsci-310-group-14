abstract="Basketball is known for the vast amounts of statistics that are collected for each player, team, game, and season. As a result, basketball is an ideal domain to work on different data analysis techniques to gain useful insights. In this study, we reviewed some important factors to predict players' future performance and being selected in an All-Star game, one of most prestigious events, of National Basket Association league. Our result showed gradient boosting machine is more qualified to predict NBA players' future performance, and balanced under-sampling random forest has better predictive ability compared to other algorithms for All-Star prediction. Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology is chosen as backbone of the project to tackle this data mining problem and provide a systematic process.",
